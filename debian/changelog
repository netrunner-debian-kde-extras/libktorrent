libktorrent (1.0.0-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Explicitly disable IPV6_V6ONLY for tcp/udp server sockets
    (Closes: #581896). The proper solution (2 sockets) will be in the next
    major upstream release (patch general_disable_ipv6_only.diff).
  * License files are in upstream tarball now, remove the respective note from
    debian/copyright.
  * Add debian/README.source.
